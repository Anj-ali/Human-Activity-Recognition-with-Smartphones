# Human-Activity-Recognition-with-Smartphones
This project is attempt to predict the activity of the person based on the data of the sensors.
I have used the dataset named Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones which has the collection of information of the users of smart phone which uses sensors to sense the different activity of te person.

You can find the dataset here - https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones

I have used the four machine learning algorithm namely Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classfier, Random Forest Classifier, K Nearest neigbour.
Out of which i got highest accuracy of 95.82626399728538% for Logistic Regression.
